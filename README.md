# BuddyBoss Pixelated Profile and Cover image issue fix
Buddyboss pixelated or blurry profile avatar image and cover image issue fixing.

### Buddyboss, a very popular theme, has a minor issue with the profile avatar and cover image. When a user uploads an image as a profile or cover photo, it converts that image to several formats, like .svg, .webp, etc. Mostly, it shows the avatar and cover image in .svg format. But the issue is that sometimes it can not format the SVG properly, so it shows a pixelated version. 

Copy the codes from [`hooks.php`](hooks.php) to your theme `functions.php` to solve the issue.
